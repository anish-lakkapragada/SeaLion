Contains PCA and tSNE, two amazing dimensionality reduction algorithms. PCA can deal with around 1000 - 10000 data points
(obviously depending on the number of dimensions.) tSNE is better for visualizations but struggles past five hundred points,
so PCA is usually better for big data and you can tSNE is for the toy datasets.

class PCA:
    """
    PCA is an algorithm to project the data to however many dimensions you want (please not 0 - LOL!). It is the most
    well known dimensionality reduction algorithm. Can work with data (10000+) very fast. We even have an inverse_transform()
    method to do reverse PCA and visualize_variance() plot method for you to find the best dimensions for your data.

    Methods
    __init__(new_ndims) :
        ->> new_ndims : just give new_ndims, the number of new dimensions you want your data to have
    transform(X) :
        ->> give your data in X, which must be a 2D numpy array or python list. 2D meaning [[]] not [] (1D.)
        ->> we will return each data point to X in new_ndims (passed in __init__) space
        ->> all code (5 lines) for this method comes from Hands On Machine Learning (Edition 2) by Aurelien Geron
    inverse_transform(X) :
        ->> reverts each point in X to its original size
        ->> keep in mind that it is very hard to get the exact same X as you originally had as PCA naturally loses
        some of the variance. However, the structure and the shape will be preserved.
    visualize_variance(X, representation_dims) :
        ->> X is the data you want to be transformed in new_ndims space
        ->> representation_dims is a list of all the dimensions you want to try your data in. For example if you give
        [3, 4, 5, 6] your data will be tried in 3, 4, 5, and 6 dimensions. The data dimension (number) will be plotted on the
        x-axis and the variance (of that projection to 3, 4, 5, and 6 dimensions here) will be on the y-axis.
        This is to help you find which dimension you should turn your data into (probably the one which has a good
        variance and is the lowest dimension.)

class tSNE:
    """
    Not as famous as PCA for Dimensionality Reduction, but very famous for Data Visualization of data in more than 3
    dimensions. The hardest part of it is the need for hyperparameter tuning, especially with the perplexity factor.
    Try as many values you get until you get visualizations you are satisfied with. The "t" stands for the
    t-distribution utilized in tSNE. A con to tSNE is its runtime - past 1000 points, tSNE can be very slow. Even with
    faster optimizations, the time complexity is O(nlogn).

    Another thing to note is the use of running it multiple times until you get the best visualization(s). You may want
    to consider running this multiple times in parallel on different cores using something like multiprocessing or
    multiprocess in python.
