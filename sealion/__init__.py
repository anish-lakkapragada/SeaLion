"""
SeaLion is a simple machine learning and data science library.

=============================================================

Designed with beginners in mind, it has rich documentation via Pydoc and algorithms that span from the most basic
to more modern approaches. It is meant to help beginners navigate it all, and the documentation not only explains t
he models and their respective functions but also what they are and when to use them. Emphasis was also put on creating
new functions to make it interesting for those who are just getting started and seasoned ml-engineers alike.

I hope you enjoy it!
